# Horiseon Social Solutions: Code Refactor

## Changes Made

### HTML

* **Descriptive Title**: added descriptive title to page

* **Semantic Elements**: changed all divs to hold accessible value (i.e. Header, Nav, Aside etc.)

* **Class Tags**: organized all class tags to minimize repetition (i.e. added sections into classes and created new ones)

* **Alt Text**: added alt text to all images
    > **Hero Image**: added title to hero image in lieu of alt text

* **Organization**: removed unneeded classes, put headers in sequence, & formatted code for legibility

### CSS

* **Condensed Code**: took out repetitive tags and classes, added in semantic element selectors

* **Accessibility**: changed color of 'seo' in title to have good contrast, checked accessibility in Inspect

* **Organization**: made sure element selectors were at the top while class selectors were at bottom
